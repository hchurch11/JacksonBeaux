                <p> I'm usually not one to seek new things on my own, but MOM and DAD keep me on my toes and introduce
                    me to so many fun things! Some of my favorites so far are: Paddle Boarding, Hiking, and Jumping on
                    to Rocks and Trees!</p>
                <p>Paddle Boarding: I was hesitant at first, but MOM and DAD encouraged me and eventually just threw me
                    into it, LITERALLY. They took me out on the paddle board, and I didn't know what to think at first,
                    so my balance was not good at all.</p>

                <p>My MOM is the best mom a dog could have. She snuggles with me, gives me all the pets and scratchies,
                    and always has treats for me. </p>
                <p>My MOM used to hit these loud thumpers with tree branches for awhile, but now she spends most of her
                    days staring at the thing that opens and shuts that sits on her desk. The open and shutter with the
                    pictures on it also makes a lot of noise when she tromps her paws onto it.

                <p>I would say that I have lots of friends, my best friends obviously being MOM and DAD. But, I also
                    have friends that look and speak like me. </p>
                <p>I meet new friends at what MOM and DAD call the "park." And sometimes I meet friends at "daycare." In
                    both of these places, I love to run around and chase my friends. </p>
